        <p>At this point, you may be wondering what the cash-strapped CPS will decide on the budget of <span id='custom-school-name1' class='custom-school-name'></span> and how that will impact your school. How has your school been spending money in the past years and what will be different given the imminent budget cut? In order to answer your question in detail, we want you to take a moment and rank: As a parent, what are your top priorities when it comes to your children's school? </p>

    <div class="budget_2015_analysis">
        <p>In 2015, <span id='custom-school-name3' class='custom-school-name'></span> received a total budget of <span id='custom-total-budget'></span>. The majority of the budget, <span id='custom-salary'></span>, was spent on teachers and staff salaries. The second largest expenditure that composed <span id='custom-benefits'></span> of the budget was benefits, which include medicare for teachers and staff personnel and pensions. Those two categories are always the most expensive costs for schools.</p>

        <p>For your school, the third area that received more investment was <span id='custom-third'></span>, a label used to determine <span id='custom-usage'></span>. If you want to know in detail about <span id='custom-school-name4' class='custom-school-name'></span>'s budget and check how close your answer is to what was adopted by the school last year, the graph below explains how much was spent on expenditures in the rest of the budget excluding salary and benefits.</p>

        <div id = "pie"></div>

        <p>These large numbers are difficult to understand, so let's help you put them in perspective.</p>

        <p>Your school may have provided <span id='custom-service-level'></span> services to students and staff than comparable schools, judging from last year’s spending on contracts. This means your children, comparing to their peers, may have spent <span id='custom-service-exp'></span> resources in services including counseling, nursing and food. This may also imply that your school provided <span id='custom-service-training'></span> professional trainings to the teachers and the staff.</p>

        <p>If you are more concerned about having quality instructional materials for your children and a comfortable study environment, <span id='custom-logic-1'></span> your school spent <span id='custom-commodity-exp'></span> the average in commodities comparing to similar schools. <span id='custom-logic-2'></span> your school spent <span id='custom-equipment-exp'></span>  the average in equipment, the investment in school building construction and maintenance. As for transportation, which covers costs associated with transporting your children to and from school and sports events, your school spent <span id='custom-transporation-exp'></span> the average than other comparable schools.</p>

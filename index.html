    <div class='capital-budget'>
        <p>A capital budget was revealed prior to August, when the entire budget will be unveiled. Capital expenditures are devoted to infrastructure such as the construction of playgrounds and the installation of air conditioning and internet. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Suffering from unprecedented financial difficulties, CPS significantly scaled back capital expenditures in its five-year-plan (2016-2020) of proposed capital budgets. This year, the capital budget is estimated to be $160.2 million, roughly 30 percent of last year’s $510 million. Until 2019, the capital budgets are expected to decrease consistently to $83.7 million and only in 2020 will it increase again to $91.3 million.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='CTU'>
        <h3>THE WEAKEST LINK OF THE CHAIN</h3>

        <p>In addition to a reduced capital budget, schools will count on less teachers and staff personnel. On June 30, the last day of 2015 budget, principals received a letter from the Board of CPS announcing that "the cuts will eliminate the equivalent of nearly 1,400 positions, including 350 vacant positions that will not be filled." 
        </p>

        <p>The next day, hundreds of demonstrators and NGOs fighting for social justice, immigration, and education rallied in front of the James R. Thompson Center to demand the end of cutbacks on state funding to social services and education.  
        </p>

        <!-- Photo gallery -->    

        <blockquote>"Can you imagine a principal trying to open up a school building and trying to staff it with the highest quality people when you do not even know which positions do you have available?"</blockquote>

        <p>"What we see with 1,400 firings is larger class sizes in every school building in our city," said Michelle Gunderson, Vice President for elementary school for Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), who participated in the rally representing public school teachers. "I'm a first grade teacher. When I am teaching children to read, the most children I can teach at a time is 5 to be effective. Every child you add over 25 [which is 5 groups of 5] impacts the social dynamics in a classroom. I don't like the person you have to become to have order and enough quiet so everybody can learn. You have to resort back to very old fashioned teaching styles, where everybody sits on their desks, does their own work quietly," said Gunderson.
        </p>

        <p>The recently announced layoffs, added Gunderson, bring uncertainty and complexity to the yearly planning because the CPS did not specify which positions would be closed. 
        </p>

        <p>"Can you imagine a principal trying to open up a school building and trying to staff it with the highest quality people when you do not even know which positions do you have available?" she said.  
        </p>

        <p>The CPS letter to principals also said that CPS will be cutting $200 million on expenditures including professional development for low performance schools, funding for newly approved charter schools, facility repair maintenance, magnet school transportation, and network offices. These cost-saving measures also include a shift in school opening times for high schools. Schools will begin classes 45 minutes later in order to decrease transportation costs - the duration of instructional time, however, will remain the same.
        </p>

        <blockquote>The schools that need the most seems to have the least. In upper-income neighborhood schools, parents have conditions to do fundraising and make up the government cuttings</blockquote>

        <p>Even without having details on next year’s budget, the Teacher’s Union argues that neighborhood schools will be most impacted. Among the schools whose budgets are decreasing, 290 of them are elementary schools, 63 are high schools, and 36 are charter schools. This also includes 9 specialty schools 6 alternative schools. 
        </p>    

        <!-- Graph -->

        <p>Pavlyn Jankov, a budget analyst for the Teacher's Union said, "We know about the budget cuts, but we don't know how it is going to play out. If we look at previous years, we see a trend: High schools have had less investments. Simultaneously, we see more investments in charter schools. Neighborhood high schools lost enrollment, had programs cut, which made it even harder for them to attract students." 
        </p>

        <p>Chances are that the effects will be greater in crime-ridden and low-income communities. 
        </p>

        <p>"The schools that need the most seems to have the least. In upper-income neighborhood schools, parents have conditions to do fundraising and make up the government cuttings,"  Sarah Hainds, also budget analyst for the Teacher’s Union, explained.
        </p>

        <p>The difference in investment between charter, contract and regular schools is easily understood when we look at the cost per student in our analysis. In 2015, a contract school student cost $11,450, a number 8.7 percent higher than the previous year. In charter schools, this cost was $10,819, an increase of 7.6 percent. In regular schools, the yearly cost of a student in 2015 is $9,974, a mere 1 percent increase. (Important note: This comparison is general and disregards factors that directly impact each school budget, such as different student needs and socioeconomic levels. However, it still gives an accurate general sense of the recent budget cuts).
        </p>

        <p>During the reporting process, CPS was contacted several times, but ignored our requests to comment the subject.

    <div class="history">
        <a name="section3" class="section"><h3>HISTORY OF A CRISIS</h3></a>
        <p>The total CPS budget increased consistently from 2013 to 2015. Last year’s total budget is 10 percent more than what was two years ago. But if the overall budget is rising, why are we in crisis? Because, even in times of scarcity, the budget has a positive fluctuation due to adjustment to inflation, variation in the number of students, and pension payments from year to year. 
        </p>

        <p>The crisis is easier to understand if you look at its sources of revenue. The budget is largely financed by local, state and federal tax collection. In Chicago, school revenue is directly linked to city property tax. According to the Ernst & Young report released in June at the request of CPS, “declining revenue over the period is largely attributed to the loss of Federal stimulus funding, declining State aid and the increasing use of GSA [General State Aid] for debt service." 
        </p>

        <blockquote>Even in times of scarcity, the budget has a positive fluctuation due to adjustment to inflation, variation in the number of students, and pension payments from year to year.</blockquote>

        <p>The numbers brought by the consultants show a structural imbalance between operational expenses and the CPS’s capacity of generating revenues. In other words, CPS is spending more money than it is able to make. The total debts since 2011 has snowballed from $500 million to a formidable amount of $1.1 billion today. If CPS continues the same borrowing and spending practices, the debt is estimated to reach as high as $5.4 billion by the fiscal year of 2020, according to the Ernst & Young report. 
        </p>

        <p>A decade ago, CPS started to borrow money – a lot of it – to balance its debts. It has borrowed aggressively by issuing bonds, derivatives, and tapping into credit, promising to repay in the long-term to cover short-term liabilities. This year CPS board announced again to allow the school system to borrow another $1 billion. 
        </p>

        <p>Typically, lending money to the government is considered a safe investment since the risk of not being paid back tends to be low. Chicago Tribune reports that in April, when CPS presented its financial predictions for investors, the board assured them that the schools would have $227 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year. 
        </p>

        <p>What we are seeing now, though, is a totally different picture: instead of surplus, debt. "CPS is projecting a cash shortfall of about $1.9 billion at the end of 2016 fiscal year and absent material cost deferral or third party intervention CPS is projected to run out of cash as early as this summer," warned the Ernst & Young report. This situation made Moody's Investors Service downgrade CPS bonds to junk status. 
        </p>

        <p>Besides swamping the future for cash, CPS has enjoyed in the past years what is called "pension holiday", a legislation to delay payment by allowing less contribution -- or none at all in a year -- to teachers’ pension. By not being obliged to adjust and increase teachers’ salaries each year, CPS agrees to contribute with a higher amount of money to teachers’ pension fund compared to most of other school systems in the U.S. However, the pension holiday is over this year and CPS is demanded to pay the snowballed contribution. 
        </p>

        <blockquote>The city is doesn't have a lot more tax capacity. The state doesn't have a lot of tax capacity. In the past they could deal with the crisis by putting a bandage on it.</blockquote>

        <p>Among all the strategies to delay and reduce payment, the one with the most lasting impact on taxpayers was redefining the beginning of a fiscal year. In order to inject about $654 millions into the 2015 budget, CPS added two months to the past fiscal year to include July and August tax collections, expanding the 2015 fiscal year to 14 months. From this year on, the tax collection will start on September instead of June. “We recognize that this helps us balance the FY15 budget but does not generate any additional revenue. It is simply a timing change that will help us provide a bridge for the FY15 budget until the time when we achieve financial stability through pension reform,” said CPS when announcing its plan to address the budget gap on 2014.

        <p>David Figlio, director for the Institute of Police Research at Northwestern University and a former CPS parent, described the situation as "kicking a can down the road". Year after year, CPS cobbled together ways of covering expenses, but it is not possible anymore.

        <p>"The realization of the crisis is present. Historically, this has been a problem. Now, suddenly, it's seen as a crisis. The city is doesn't have a lot more tax capacity. The state doesn't have a lot of tax capacity. In the past they could deal with the crisis by putting a bandage on it. Now, it is hard to deal with it."

        <p>This is why, if you are a parent, you may be feeling that you have seen this play before. But next chapters will probably be an entirely new story.
